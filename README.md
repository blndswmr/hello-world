About Me:

I am a seasoned professional with 15+ years at interactive agencies and technology startups holding positions across creative, development, and account disciplines. For the last 3 years I have been passionately working at the forefront of the mobile technology space, helping innovative companies harness the power of tablets, building interactive experiences to drive transformative growth and gain a competitive advantage. As both an Art Director and front-end developer, I have a strong technical and product expertise, including the ability to analyze business problems effectively from a user-centered design perspective, working cross-functionally to prioritize and create award-winning user experiences. Additionally, as an experienced Account Director with Fortune 500 companies, I have excellent communication skills, including the ability to uncover and crystallize insights into business needs that the stakeholders themselves may not be able to articulate. Lastly, I have managed and mentored visual designers, project managers, account managers, and front-end developers, helping each of my direct reports to grow as individuals while also fostering and leading high-functioning teams.
